1. You can comment line number 357(nltk.download('words') after first run. This is the line which loads the english letters list.
2. If you want to populate the top 5 scorer at the end, ensure you download the ScoreSheet.csv to the python project.
3. Else the top 5 scorer during the first run will be the player score who played the game for the first time.
4. The library used in code does not accept plurals.
5. The library does not have all known english words in it. So it might give error for some words as 'Not a proper english word'
6. Hope you enjoy the game !!!
